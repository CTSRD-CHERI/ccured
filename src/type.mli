(* This is the main (conceptual) entry point for this file.
 *
 * These remarks apply to "subtype" and "equal", both of which are
 * implemented using an underlying function called "compare". 
 * 
 * Use physical subtyping (a la Reps, etc.) to determine the relationship
 * between t1 and t2. In general, this is similar to width subtyping (like
 * in object oriented languages) with the following exceptions:
 *
 * (1) "void*" is treated as a type variable and special handling exists
 *     to replace a "void*" with its representative type. Any direct
 *     comparison with a representative-less "void*" type succeeds. 
 * (2) A special "compat" function is called on all pointers that must have
 *     the same physical representation and on all pointers that area
 *     compared against a representative-less "void*" type. 
 * (3) A special "failure" function is called on all internal pointers that
 *     "fail to match up correctly" and must thus have their types checked
 *     at run-time (e.g., by making them WILD in CCured). "compare" can
 *     return true even if some lower-level pointers fail to match up,
 *     provided that it calls "failure" on them. 
 *
 * Because memoization is used to prevent this from taking too much time
 * over the course of the analysis, "compat" and "failure" are only
 * guaranteed to be called once per pair of types, even across many
 * invocations of "compare".
