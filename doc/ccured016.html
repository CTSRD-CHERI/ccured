<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc97">C.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;ftpd</H2>
<B>Note: this section was written on 6/29/01. CCured has changed since
 then.</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Once you download the sources for a new package, you can run the translator
on it. To create a Makefile target for a package you typically add to
cil/Makefile a target that just invokes make on the package's own Makefile
with the CC variable bound to &#8220;ccured &ndash;merge&#8221;. I'll use the 6/29/01 version
of ftpd as my example.<BR>
<BR>
First we try to run it without our tool involved:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  % make ftpd-clean
  % cd test/ftpd/ftpd
  % make
</PRE>This succeeds, generating an 'ftpd' binary. In the case of 'ftpd', 
running it is slightly complicated:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  % ./ftpd -D -d -p 3333
  (then in another window)
  % telnet localhost 3333
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  220 madrone.cs.berkeley.edu FTP server (Version 6.5/OpenBSD, linux port 0.3.2) ready.
  (etc)
</PRE>This is (to our way of measuring) success.<BR>
<BR>
Now we try it in 'cil' mode:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  % cd cil
  % make ftpd-clean
  % make ftpd
</PRE>At the moment, this also works, producing another 'ftpd' binary. We test
it the same way, and rejoice at its success.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, we dare to try it in 'box' mode, meaning the instrumentation
module will be used:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  % make ftpd-clean
  % make ftpd INFERBOX=4
</PRE>After crunching for a while, it reports this error (you have to scroll
back a bit to see the right one):
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  ./ls_all.c:1338: Bug: Calling non-wild ioctl with too many args
</PRE>
This is an error from the 'box' module, complaining about what it
perceives to be a type error. If we investigate the named source
line, we see
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  if(ioctl(1, 0x5413, &amp; win) == 0 &amp;&amp; win.ws_col &gt; 0)
</FONT></PRE>
confirming that 'ioctl' is involved. Since the <TT>*_all.c</TT> files are the
output of our tool, and do not themselves <TT>#include</TT> any files, we can
simply search in this file for ioctl's declaration. We do so, and see
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  extern int ioctl(int __fd , unsigned long int __request , ...) ;
</FONT></PRE>
Hmmm... looks like it was declared to accept any number (&gt;=2) of args, so
this looks like a bug in the 'box' module; it should accept this code,
but it does not.<BR>
<BR>
The next step is to write a tiny C program which calls ioctl (see
test/small2/ioctl.c), and verify it fails the same way
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  % make scott/ioctl INFERBOX=4
  [...]
  ioctl.c:9: Bug: Calling non-wild ioctl with too many args
  [...]
</FONT></PRE>
Yep, same problem. Now we report this to George, since typically he's
much faster at identifying the problem, since he wrote the 'box' module.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime (waiting for George to magically fix the problem), we
could temporarily comment-out the call so we can proceed to find other
bugs. Or, perhaps we change the ioctl call to instead call a wrapper
function (wrappers are defined in lib/ccuredlib.c, which gets linked into
the translated program).<BR>
<BR>
Eventually (see "make go INFERBOX=4") we'll get an executable. If it
runs correctly, celebration is in order. If not, it will usually fail
because of a failed runtime check (this one is from a test vector for
which go fails);
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  % make go INFERBOX=4
  % cd test/spec/099.go/src
  % ./go 5 4
  [...]
  array bug: index is 5980 (vs 5980)
  Failure: Ubound
  Abort
</FONT></PRE>
Tracking down the source of such failures is the most time-consuming
part of pushing a program through. Sometimes it's a bug in the
translator, in which case ideally a test case can be isolated for easy
diagnosis.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes (more and more often) it's a bug in the original program (go
had 10 array bounds violation bugs at last count). In this case you
have to change the original code to fix the bug; this may be easy or
hard. If it's hard, try just surrounding the offending statement with
an explicit bounds check in an 'if' statement, so the program skips
the bad statements (that is what I did to cause all of the "array bug"
outputs in the "5 4" case above).<BR>

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc98">C.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing Wrappers Manually</H2><A NAME="sec-manualwrappers"></A>
To interface with external code, you are usually better off using the automatic
wrapper system described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="ccured008.html#ch-wrapper">8</A>. However if that isn't possible,
you'll need to write a wrapper directly in C:
<DL CLASS="description" COMPACT=compact><DT CLASS="dt-description">
<B>Step 1:</B><DD CLASS="dd-description"> 
 Consult the name-mangling algorithm documented Section&nbsp;<A HREF="ccured008.html#sec-mangling">8.1</A>
 and <TT>ccuredlib.c</TT> to decode the required types of the parameters. <BR>
<BR>
<DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>Step 2:</B><DD CLASS="dd-description">
 Determine the semantics of the function being wrapped (e.g.,
 if it's a unix libc call, consult its man page). In particular,
 find out how memory passed via pointers is accessed (read and
 written).<BR>
<BR>
<DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>Step 3:</B><DD CLASS="dd-description">
 Write the wrapper, and make calls to the verification
 and query functions in the section in <TT>ccuredlib.c</TT> titled 
 &#8220;general-purpose&#8221;. If the function manipulates wild pointers, 
 be sure to update tags; conversely, if no wild pointers are 
 involved, there are no tags to worry about.

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc99">C.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apache Modules</H2>
<EM>This section applies to CCured as of July 2002</EM><BR>
<BR>

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc100">C.3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H3>
This writing assumes Apache 1.3.19 and an x86/Linux system. Apache is an
open source web server that has the ability to dynamically load third-party
modules. Modules can examine and alter HTTP requests and also examine and
alter the webserver replies. For example, a compression module might
examine the HTTP request to see if it contains the &#8220;Accept-Encoding:
gzip&#8221; tag. If it does it might alter the HTTP reply, replacing the text of
the webpage body with a compressed version of that text. Modules can be
configured (via a file called <TT>httpd.conf</TT>) so that their behavior is
limited to a certain location or directory. <BR>
<BR>
Apache modules share the same address space as the Apache webserver: no
software fault isolation is present. As a result, if the module crashes it
brings down that webserver (although apache is usually configured to
immediately spawn a new webserver thread to replace the fallen one). More
distressingly, a module with a security violation (for example, a
format-string bug) can allow remote users to gain shell access to the
webserver machine (one version of <TT>mod_php3</TT> features such a
vulnerability: CCured prevents that vulnerability). <BR>
<BR>
Apache modules are typically single files with a fairly standard naming
convention: <TT>mod_foo.c</TT> is the <TT>foo</TT> module, where <TT>foo</TT>
ranges over fairly descriptive keywords like <TT>gzip</TT>, <TT>random</TT>, <TT>urlcount</TT>, <TT>auth</TT> or <TT>layout</TT>. <TT>mod_foo.c</TT> almost invariable
contains a global data structure of type <TT>module</TT> with the C name <TT>foo_module</TT>. This data structure is a table of function pointers and entry
points. Once <TT>mod_foo.c</TT> has been compiled to the shared object <TT>mod_foo.so</TT>, Apache will dynamically load it and call the function
pointers listed in the <TT>foo_module</TT> structure at the appropriate time
(e.g., when a new request comes in). <BR>
<BR>

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc101">C.3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Curing Apache Modules</H3>
Most Apache modules are of a relatively modest size and curing them is no
great chore. However, some annotation work must be done. Since the cured
module must interact with the non-cured Apache webserver, objects that are
passed between them must not change size. As a result, <TT>WILD</TT> and other
fat pointers cannot be introduced into such objects. Annotations must be
added to convince CCured that the module can be made safe without such
run-time checks. <BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you are trying to cure <TT>mod_urlcount.c</TT>. Take out your
favorite text editor and open up the file. Near the top you should find a
configuration record structure. Each module defines a separate
configuration record structure with a separate (non-exported) name. For
example, <TT>mod_urlcount</TT> has:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
typedef struct urlcount_config_rec {
    int         urlcount_default;
    CounterType urlcount_type;
    int         urlcount_auto_add;
    char       *urlcount_file;
} urlcount_config_rec;
</FONT></PRE>
Each module also contains functions that create, manipulate and merge such
configuration structures. This is the mechanism through which Apache modules
maintain global state. Each time Apache calls one of the function pointers
exported by the module, it passes along a way to get to the appropriate
configuration record. Since Apache does not know how the config structure
will be defined, it uses <TT>void</TT> pointers to describe the type. CCured
comes with a set of macros that instantiate those <TT>void *</TT>s on a
per-module basis. Add the line:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
NEW_MODULE_TYPE(urlcount, urlcount_config_rec)  // this is a macro
</FONT></PRE>
where the first parameter is the module suffix name and the second is the
type name of the configuration record. This macro declares a type named
<TT>module_urlcount</TT>. As mentioned earlier, each module exports a module
structure (full of function pointers). We must redeclare the module to take
advantage of the instantiated types. Change:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
module urlcount_module; // full of "void *"s
</FONT></PRE>
to
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
module_urlcount urlcount_module; // uses "url_config_rec *", not "void *"
</FONT></PRE>
Now scroll down a bit and look for the word keyword <TT>void</TT>. Apache
modules often feature unnecessary casts to void. For example, <TT>mod_headers</TT> contains this function:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
static void *merge_headers_config(pool *p, void *basev, void *overridesv)
{
    headers_conf *a = (headers_conf *) ap_pcalloc(p, sizeof(headers_conf));
    headers_conf *base = (headers_conf *) basev, 
        *overrides = (headers_conf *) overridesv;
    a-&gt;headers = ap_append_arrays(p, base-&gt;headers, overrides-&gt;headers);
    return a;
}
</FONT></PRE>
Every <TT>void</TT> in this function really stands for <TT>headrs_conf</TT> (the
<TT>mod_headers</TT> version of <TT>urlcount_config_rec</TT>). Change it so
that the <TT>void</TT> types are no longer present: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
static headers_conf *
    merge_headers_config(pool *p, headers_conf *basev, headers_conf *overridesv)
{
    headers_conf *a = (headers_conf *) ap_pcalloc(p, sizeof(headers_conf));
    headers_conf *base = (headers_conf *) basev, 
        *overrides = (headers_conf *) overridesv;
    a-&gt;headers = ap_append_arrays(p, base-&gt;headers, overrides-&gt;headers);
    return a;
}
</FONT></PRE>
Repeat this process with all configuration functions that contain <TT>void</TT>. Now search for <TT>ap_get_module_config</TT>. It is a macro that
contains a (safe) cast to and from <TT>void *</TT> &ndash; it allows modules to
extract their configuration record from the global server state. For
example, <TT>mod_headers</TT> contains:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
headers_conf *serverconf =
    (headers_conf *) ap_get_module_config(s-&gt;module_config, &amp;headers_module);
</FONT></PRE>
Change this to:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
    headers_conf * serverconf;
    { __NOBOXBLOCK
    serverconf = ap_get_module_config(s-&gt;module_config, &amp;headers_module);
    } 
</FONT></PRE>
The <TT>__NOBOXBLOCK</TT> block keyword tells CCured to leave the block
alone: we are asserting that it is already safe. Modify every instance of
<TT>ap_get_module_config</TT> and <TT>ap_get_perdir_module_config</TT>
the same way. <BR>
<BR>
Now look for a datatype with the suffix <TT>entry</TT>. For example, <TT>mod_headers</TT> features:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
typedef struct {
    hdr_actions action;
    char *header;
    char *value;
} header_entry;
</FONT></PRE>
This marks a use of Apache's polymorphic (via <TT>void *</TT>) array routines. 
Insert the following macro declaration to tell CCured about this array
type:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
NEW_TABLE_TYPE(header_entry, header_entry)      // macro
</FONT></PRE>
This macro declares a new type, <TT>array_header_FOO</TT> (where <TT>FOO</TT>
is the first argument) that is a specialized version of the Apache-provided
type <TT>array_header</TT>. Other data structure (for example, the
configuration record structure) will contain <TT>array_header</TT>s. We
change them to use this new datatype. Change all declarations like:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
typedef struct {
    array_header *headers;
} headers_conf;
</FONT></PRE>
into:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
typedef struct {
    array_header_header_entry *headers;
} headers_conf;
</FONT></PRE>
Now search for every call to <TT>ap_make_array</TT>, <TT>ap_append_arrays</TT>, <TT>ap_push_array</TT> and append <TT>FOO</TT> (in our
running example, <TT>header_entry</TT>) to the name of each called function.
For example, change: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
new = (header_entry *) ap_push_array(dirconf-&gt;headers);
</FONT></PRE>
into:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
new = (header_entry *) ap_push_array_header_entry(dirconf-&gt;headers);
</FONT></PRE>
Finally, surround all global table declarations with <TT>#pragma</TT>s that
tell CCured to leave them alone (because Apache must read them). Often
there are three such global tables per module. One is an array of <TT>struct const command_rec</TT>s, one is an array of <TT>struct const
handler_rec</TT>s, and the last is a <TT>module</TT>. Surround them all with <TT>#pragma</TT>s as follows:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
static const handler_rec mod_gzip_handlers[] =
{
    {"mod_gzip_handler", mod_gzip_handler},
    {CGI_MAGIC_TYPE,     mod_gzip_handler},
    {"cgi-script",       mod_gzip_handler},
    {"*",                mod_gzip_handler},
    {NULL}
};
</FONT></PRE>
becomes:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
#pragma box(off)
static const handler_rec mod_gzip_handlers[] =
{
    {"mod_gzip_handler", mod_gzip_handler},
    {CGI_MAGIC_TYPE,     mod_gzip_handler},
    {"cgi-script",       mod_gzip_handler},
    {"*",                mod_gzip_handler},
    {NULL}
};
#pragma box(on)
</FONT></PRE>
Finally, change the declaration of the global module to use the new
specialized type we created earlier. For example, change:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
module MODULE_VAR_EXPORT urlcount_module = {
</FONT></PRE>
into:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
module_urlcount MODULE_VAR_EXPORT urlcount_module = {
</FONT></PRE>
Voilà. <BR>
<BR>

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc102">C.3.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linking Apache Modules</H3>
Suppose you have just finished making the source modifications to <TT>mod_foo.c</TT>. Now you want to test it on Apache. Use CCured to compile it to
<TT>mod_foo.o</TT>. Make sure that there are no <TT>WILD</TT> pointers and that 
the sizes of types involved in the apache-module interface did not change. 
Now you must link it:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
    $ gcc -shared -o mod_foo.so mod_foo.o
    $ cp mod_foo.so /path/to/apache/bin/
</PRE>
Now go to your Apache binary directory and edit <TT>httpd.conf</TT>. Go to the
<TT>LoadModule</TT> section and add something appropriate according to the
documentation for your module. For example, <TT>mod_usertrack</TT> can be
configured by adding:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
LoadModule usertrack_module bin/mod_usertrack.so
CookieTracking On
CookieExpires "1 days"
</PRE>
Now try to start Apache:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
    $ ./apachectl stop
    $ ./apachectl start
    ./apachectl start: httpd started
</PRE>
If you see the &#8220;<TT>httpd started</TT>&#8221; message, it worked. If there were
messages about undefined symbols, you probably have to write a few
wrappers. For example, you might see:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
    ./httpd: undefined symbol strdup_ff: mod_foo cannot be loaded
</PRE>
In this case you must write a wrapper for <TT>strdup</TT> that uses <TT>FSEQ</TT>
pointers. Suppose you write it in <TT>wrapper_foo.c</TT> and compile that to
<TT>wrapper_foo.o</TT>. Now go back to the linking step: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
    $ gcc -shared -o mod_foo.so mod_foo.o wrapper_foo.o
    $ cp mod_foo.so /path/to/apache/bin/
</PRE>
And try to start Apache again. Eventually this process converges (you can
skip ahead by using a utility like <TT>nm</TT> to list all of the undefined
symbols in <TT>mod_foo.so</TT> if you like) and your Apache module will be up
and running.<BR>
<BR>
If for some reasons your Apache module crashes at run-time, consider using
the underlying CIL <TT>&ndash;logcalls</TT> mechanism to track down the error
(Apache modules do not treat well with normal debuggers). Make sure that
the debugging comments are directed to <TT>syslog(3)</TT> rather than <TT>printf(3)</TT> or somesuch. <BR>
<BR>
As daunting as it may seem, it actually takes less than 30 minutes to Cure
an Apache module of average size and get it up and running. Some of that
time is spend reading the module's documentation so that it can be loaded
and tested correctly. Good luck!<BR>
